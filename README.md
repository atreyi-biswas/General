# 🚀 My Learning Repository

Welcome to my learning journey through programming and design! This repository documents everything I’m exploring—from coding in low-level languages like **C/C++**, to mastering high-level tools like **Figma**, **HTML**, and **Python**, and even diving into professional design courses. My aim is to strengthen both my programming skills and design thinking.

### 📘 C Programming
---

Welcome to my programming journey through **C**—a powerful, structured, and low-level language that helps build strong fundamentals.  
In this section, I'm learning:
- Data types, operators, conditionals, and loops  
- Arrays, strings, functions, and recursion  
- Pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and structures  
- File handling and basic algorithm design  

💡 I'm also working on:
- Mini projects like student record systems, calculators, and games  
- DSA concepts like sorting, searching, and linked lists using C  
- Lab assignments and handwritten notes  

> 🧠 My goal: Gain full control over memory, logic, and execution flow — the building blocks of any system.

---

### 📗 C++ Programming
---

This section is all about leveling up through **C++**, building on my C base but going deeper into object-oriented and modern programming paradigms.  
Topics I'm learning include:
- Classes, objects, constructors, and destructors  
- Inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation  
- Operator overloading and exception handling  
- STL: vectors, maps, sets, stacks, queues, and algorithms  

💡 Projects and practice:
- Console-based projects like Tic Tac Toe, Sudoku Solver, and scientific calculators  
- Solving Leetcode/Codeforces problems with STL  
- Applying OOP in real-life use cases  

> 🎯 My goal: Write modular, reusable code and master abstraction, encapsulation, and algorithmic thinking.

### 🎨 Master Digital Product Design: UX Research & UI Design
---

This professional-level course focuses on building complete digital products with solid UX foundations.  
What I’m learning:
- UX research, competitive analysis, and user psychology  
- Creating personas, user flows, and journey maps  
- Wireframing with low-fidelity and high-fidelity designs  
- Prototyping, user testing, and iterative design  

💡 Tools & Outputs:
- Use of FigJam, Notion, and Figma for planning and prototyping  
- Case studies for mobile/web apps with mock pitches  
- Real-world examples of task flows and usability improvements  

> 🎨 My goal: Design intuitive, problem-solving interfaces backed by research, not just aesthetics.

---

### ✨ Figma UI/UX Design Advanced
---

Here I dive deep into interface design using **Figma**, pushing beyond just wireframes into real, usable UIs.  
Topics covered:
- Auto Layout, components, variants, and design tokens  
- Prototyping flows with interactions and animations  
- Design systems and style guides  
- Responsive and grid-based layouts  

💡 Practical work:
- Recreating popular apps like Spotify, Instagram, and Dribbble pages  
- Portfolio projects using interactive prototypes  
- Collaborative workflows with developer handoff in mind  

> 🖌️ My goal: Build pixel-perfect, responsive UI designs that feel modern, functional, and delightful.

### 🌐 HTML and CSS
---

This section is where I explore **front-end web development** using HTML and CSS.  
Core topics include:
- HTML semantics, tables, forms, and multimedia  
- CSS styling, colors, fonts, Flexbox, and Grid  
- Media queries and responsive design  
- Animations, transitions, and pseudo-classes  

💡 Practice includes:
- Creating static websites from scratch  
- Building web pages like personal portfolio, landing pages, and design clones  
- Learning clean code practices and accessibility basics  

> 🌍 My goal: Understand how the web works at the visual and structure level, and build beautiful layouts without JavaScript.

---

### 🐍 Python Programming
---

Here I explore **Python**, a powerful and flexible high-level language known for simplicity and versatility.  
Topics I’m covering:
- Syntax, data types, conditionals, loops, and functions  
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets  
- File handling, modules, OOP with classes and inheritance  
- Error handling and input/output operations  

💡 Applications and projects:
- CLI tools and basic automation scripts  
- File organizer, password manager, and to-do list app  
- Starting with NumPy, Pandas, and matplotlib for data-related tasks  

> 🐍 My goal: Use Python for practical scripting, data manipulation, and backend or automation tasks in the future.

---

### 📙 JavaScript
---

The language that powers the web! JavaScript brings interactivity, logic, and dynamic behavior to websites and web apps, making it one of the most essential tools for any developer.

📘 Topics I'm Learning
- Basics: variables, constants, data types, and operators  
- Conditionals, loops, and functions (including arrow functions)  
- DOM manipulation and event handling  
- Arrays, objects, and higher-order functions  
- ES6+ features like template literals, destructuring, and modules  

---

🧩 Concepts Explored
- Synchronous vs Asynchronous programming (Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await)  
- Local & Session Storage for browser-based data saving  
- Error handling and debugging using **console tools**  
- Writing modular, clean, and reusable code  

---

> 🎯 My goal: To master **client-side interactivity** and prepare for **React.js**, **Node.js**, and **Full-Stack Development**, creating web applications that are both **functional** and **engaging**.
