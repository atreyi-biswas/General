## 🔷 C Programming

The C language forms the backbone of systems programming. I'm focusing on deeply understanding how things work at the hardware-near level.

### ✅ Topics Covered
- **Basic Syntax:** Variables, data types, operators, control flow
- **Functions:** Definition, declaration, recursion, scope
- **Arrays & Strings:** Memory layout, manipulation
- **Pointers:** Pointer arithmetic, arrays vs pointers, pointer to pointer
- **Dynamic Memory:** malloc, calloc, realloc, free
- **Structures & Unions:** Data grouping, memory usage
- **File I/O:** Reading from and writing to files with `fopen`, `fscanf`, etc.
- **Modular Programming:** Header files, separating logic

### 🛠️ Projects
- Unit Converter
- Simple Calculator
- Number System Converter
- File I/O Utility (read/write files)
- Custom String Functions (e.g., own `strlen`, `strcpy`)

📁 Check out [`c/`](./c/) for implementation.

## 🔶C++ Programming

C++ builds on C and introduces high-level constructs like classes and templates. Here, I'm learning how to design efficient, reusable, and maintainable code.

### ✅ Topics Covered
- **C++ Syntax & Basics:** Variables, functions, references, inline functions
- **Object-Oriented Programming:**
  - Classes and Objects
  - Encapsulation and Abstraction
  - Inheritance and Polymorphism
  - Access Specifiers (public, private, protected)
- **Constructor & Destructor Mechanics**
- **Function and Operator Overloading**
- **Templates:** Function & Class templates
- **Exception Handling:** try-catch blocks, throwing exceptions
- **STL (Standard Template Library):**
  - Vectors, Maps, Sets, Queues, Stacks
  - Iterators and Algorithms (`sort`, `find`, etc.)
- **File Handling in C++**

### 🧠 DSA in C++
Using both raw implementation and STL-based approaches to solve:

- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists (singly/doubly)
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Binary Search Trees
- Graphs (BFS, DFS)
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Basic Dynamic Programming

### 🛠️ Projects
- Bank Management System
- Quiz Game
- File Encryptor/Decryptor
- Student Report System
- OOP-based Mini Apps (e.g., Bookstore, ATM simulation)

📁 Visit [`cpp/`](./cpp/) to explore the code.
