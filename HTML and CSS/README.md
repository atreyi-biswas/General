# 🌱 My HTML & CSS Learning Journey
> *"HTML taught me how to structure. CSS taught me how to express."*

## 🧠 Why I Starte
- I was drawn to beautiful websites and wanted to design and build them myself  
- I enjoy organizing layouts and creating structure visually  
- I love seeing immediate results — changing just one line of CSS and watching the page transform

## 📘 How I Learned
- Started with HTML basics: headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists  
- Learned CSS styling: fonts, colors, spacing, shadows, and gradients  
- Explored layout systems like **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**  
- Rebuilt small sections of real websites to understand structure and responsiveness  
- Used Figma as a reference while turning static designs into code

## 🛠️ Tools I Used
- VS Code + Live Server for instant feedback  
- Figma for wireframes and visual inspiration  
- GitHub for hosting and tracking changes  
- DevTools for testing responsive behavior

## 📁 Folder Structure
- HTML Notes: Contains all HTML Tags and it's meanings
- HTML-Only Website: Covers all HTML basic learning

## 🚀 What's Next
- Continue improving layouts and responsive design  
- Learn accessibility and better semantic HTML practices  
- Explore more creative layouts, scroll effects, and CSS-only animations
